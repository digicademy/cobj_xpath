## About

This TYPO3 extension adds a new content object XPATH to the standard TypoScript cObjects. The XPATH cObject allows for a flexible, TypoScript based treatment of any kind of XML data. The data can be read from database fields, files or external resources.

This is the development repository for cobj_xpath. You can find the official extension releases in the [TYPO3 Extension Repository](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/cobj_xpath)

The documentation is at [https://docs.typo3.org/p/digicademy/cobj_xpath/master/en-us/](https://docs.typo3.org/p/digicademy/cobj_xpath/master/en-us/).
